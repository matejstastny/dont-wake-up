# 💤 **Don't Wake Up**

> Made with **Unity 2023.2.12f1**  
> Senior Final Project – *Video Game Design*, Redmond High School 2025

## 🧠 Concept

You're inside your own brain... dreaming.  
But it's not peaceful — **energy drinks** are invading your mind.  
If they touch you, you lose a life. Lose all 3? You **wake up**.

Armed only with a handful of **melatonin gummies** and a **flashlight**, you must fight off waves of caffeinated chaos in the dark. The deeper you sleep, the more they come.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🕹️ **3D first-person gameplay**
- 🌑 **Dark dreamscape** lit only by your flashlight
- 🥤 **Wave-based enemies**
    - Wave number = number of enemies
    - New wave spawns when all current energy drinks are defeated
- 🐻 **Melatonin gummies** as weapons
- ❤️ **3 lives** before you wake up
- 👻 **Creepy vibes** — you never know when a drink might sneak up behind you...
